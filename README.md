# DFS Custom Map Solver 🧩

A maze-solving application that uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to navigate through a maze and find the path from the start to the goal position. The program allows the user to either use default settings or input custom maze configurations.

## Files Content 📄

### `MazeSolver.py`

This file contains the code that implements the maze solver using the DFS algorithm. It also creates the maze and visualizes the solution using agents in a graphical interface.

### Key Functions 🔑

- **DFS(m, start=None)**: Implements the Depth-First Search algorithm to solve the maze.
- **executemaze(ro, co, speed, start_pos, goal_pos, loop)**: Executes the maze creation, solving, and visualization based on user input or default settings.

### Key Variables 🧑‍💻
- `m`: The maze object.
- `start_pos`: The starting position of the agent.
- `goal_pos`: The goal position of the agent.
- `dSearch`: A list of the path taken during DFS.
- `dfsPath`: A dictionary containing the DFS path for backtracking.
- `fwdPath`: The final path from the start to the goal.

### Execution Flow 🔄

- The program either starts with default settings or asks the user to input custom maze data, including rows, columns, start position, goal position, and speed.
- The maze is created and solved using the DFS algorithm.
- The program visualizes the path taken by agents and marks cells where multiple paths are possible.

## Installation ⚙️

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhil-gorasa/mazesolver-py.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pyamaze
   ```

## Usage 🚀

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python MazeSolver.py
   ```

2. Choose one of the following options:

   - **Option 1**: Use default settings.
     - Rows and columns are set to 10.
     - Start position is `(5, 1)` and goal position is `(2, 4)`.
     - Speed is set to 100.

   - **Option 2**: Provide custom maze settings.
     - Enter the number of rows and columns.
     - Specify the start and goal positions.
     - Adjust the speed (1 is fastest).
     - Enable loops by entering 100.
